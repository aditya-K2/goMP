# Configuration

Configuration of gomp is done through a `config.yml` file in `$HOME/.config/gomp/`

It is essential to have some config options defined in order to have a smooth experience.

# Essential Config Options

These are the config options that you must define.

### Default Image Path

This is the Fallback Image that will be rendered if gomp doesn't find the embedded cover art or LastFM Cover Art.

```yml
DEFAULT_IMAGE_PATH : "/path/to/default/image"
```
### MPD Port

This is the port where your Music Player Daemon Is Running.

##### If not provided gomp looks for the port in mpd.conf in `~/.config/mpd/`

```yml
MPD_PORT : "6600"
```

### Music Directory

The Most Essential config option is `MUSIC_DIRECTORY` It is the path to your Music Folder that you have provided to mpd
in the `mpd.conf` file. If you do not provide the path to the `MUSIC_DIRECTORY` then gomp parses the mpd.conf file for
the `music_directory` option ( It is to be noted that gomp assumes that your mpd.conf file is at
`$HOME/.config/mpd/mpd.conf`

```yml
MUSIC_DIRECTORY : "~/Music"
```

The reason why you need to setup `MUSIC_DIRECTORY` manually because the paths to the songs received from mpd are relative the `MUSIC_DIRECTORY`.

# Other Config Options

## Network Type

By Default gomp assumes that you connect to MPD Server through tcp, But if your MPD Server is configured to expose a unix socket rather than a port, then you can specify network type to "unix"
Defaults to `tcp` if not provided.

```yml
NETWORK_TYPE : "unix"
```

Read More about it in the [sample_config](https://github.com/aditya-K2/gomp/blob/master/sample_config.yml)

## Network Address

The Address of the Host for e.g `"localhost"` or `"/path/to/unix/socket/"` if you are using unix sockets
Defaults to `localhost` if not provided.

```yml
NETWORK_ADDRESS : "/home/$USER/.mpd/socket"
```

Read More about it in the [sample_config](https://github.com/aditya-K2/gomp/blob/master/sample_config.yml)

## Seek Offset

The amount of seconds by which the current song should seek forward or backward.

```yml
SEEK_OFFSET : 5
```

## Redraw Interval

The amount of milliseconds after which the cover art should be redrawn if there is a event.

```yml
REDRAW_INTERVAL : 500
```

## Database Path

The path where the database of playtime of all the songs is stored.

```yml
DB_PATH : "~/.cache/gompDB"
```
## Cache Directory

By Default Images are cached to avoid re-extracting images and making redundant API Calls. The Extracted Images are copied to the `CACHE_DIR`.

```yml
CACHE_DIR : "/path/to/the/cache/Directory/"
```

Read More about Caching in the [sample_config](https://github.com/aditya-K2/gomp/blob/master/sample_config.yml)

# Image Rendering

## Additional Padding and Extra Image Width

The Default Position of the Image without any configuration assumes that you have no font or terminal padding or margin so Image will
be rendered at different places in different terminals, Also the TUIs calculates positions with the respect to rows and columns
and the image is rendered at pixel positions so the exact position can't be defined [ the app tries its best by calculating
the font width and then predicting the position but it is best that you define some extra padding and your own image width ratio
in config.yml. Please Read more about it in the [sample_config](https://github.com/aditya-K2/gomp/blob/master/sample_config.yml)

for e.g

```yml
# Default Values. Might be different than sample_config.yml
ADDITIONAL_PADDING_X : 11
ADDITIONAL_PADDING_Y : 18

IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_X  : -0.7
IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_Y  : -2.6
```
![Cover Art Position](./assets/default.png)

Let's say upon opening gomp for the first time and your image is rendered this way.

Here the `Y` Position is too low hence we have to decrease the `ADDITIONAL_PADDING_Y` so that image will be rendered
in a better position so we decrement the  `ADDITIONAL_PADDING_Y` by `9`

Now the configuration becomes
```yml
ADDITIONAL_PADDING_Y : 9
```

and the image appears like this:

![Padding](./assets/padding.png)

One might be happy the way things turn out but for the perfectionist like me this is not enough.
You can notice that the Height of the image is a little bit more than the box height and hence the image is flowing outside the box. Now it's  time to change the `WIDTH_Y`.

Width can be changed by defining the `IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_Y` and `IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_X` it act's a little differently think of it like a chunk which is either added or subtracted from the image's original width. We can look at the configuration and realize that the chunk `IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_Y` when subtracted from the original `IMAGE_WIDTH` doesn't get us the proper result and is a little to low. We need to subtract a more bigger chunk, Hence we will increase the magnitude of `IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_Y` or decrease `IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_Y`

Now the Configuration becomes:
```yml
IMAGE_WIDTH_EXTRA_Y : - 3.2
```
and the image appears like this:

![Width](./assets/width.png)

Which looks perfect. ðŸŽ‰

Please change the configuration according to your needs.

# Key Mappings

Following Keys can be used for Mappings

| Keys            | Using them in Config  |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| a-z             | a-z                   |
| A-Z             | A-z                   |
| {,},(,),[,],<,> | {,},(,),[,],<,>       |
| Enter(Return)   | ENTER/RETURN          |
| Tab             | TAB                   |
| Space           | SPACE                 |

See config/kMap.go for more information

For mapping a key to some function use the following format:


```yml
Function: [ firstMapping, secondMapping, thirdMapping]
```
for e.g


```yml
togglePlayBack : [ "p", "TAB", "[" ] # using the quotes is neccessary.
```

Following functions are provided :

# Colors and Style

You can change `colors` and `styles` for some of the aspects of `gomp`

Let's say to you want to change Color of Artist from the default Purple to Red

In your `config.yml`
```yml
COLORS:
  artist:
    foreground: Red

  # Another Example
  pbar_artist:
    foreground: "#ff0000" # For Hex Values
    bold: True # Changes the Style
    italic: False
```
